                    A window sticker—also known as a Monroney sticker—is that label you often see on new cars sitting in
                    dealer lots. It lists out important information about the vehicle, including features, pricing, fuel
                    economy, safety ratings, and sometimes even warranty details.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
                    It&apos;s like a vehicle&apos;s resume, giving you an at-a-glance look at everything the manufacturer originally
                    included in that specific car. When the car is new, the window sticker is on display. But as time goes
                    on, it often gets lost. That&apos;s why getting a replacement window sticker, especially for a used Toyota,
                    is essential.

                  <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
                    A Toyota Window Sticker specifically details everything you&apos;d need to know about a Toyota vehicle when
                    it first left the factory. This includes the model, trim level, engine type, transmission, safety
                    features, and all the extra options that were added.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
                    Many Toyota models come in different trims and with optional packages. Without the window sticker, it&apos;s
                    hard to know if the vehicle has a sunroof, leather seats, advanced safety systems, or upgraded stereo,
                    which can lead to a better experience for the buyer. That&apos;s where the VIN (Vehicle Identification
                    Number) comes into play—it&apos;s your key to unlocking all this information, including the monroney sticker.

                  Cars built before 1981 have shorter VINs, usually around 11 characters long. These older cars don&apos;t

                  Before buying a used car, you should always check the title to see if there are any liens on it. A lien

                  window sticker.
